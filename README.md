# RISCV Assembly Simulator
A RISC-V RV32I Assembly simulator implemented using C++ for the main 40 instructions of the RISC-V language. It helps traicing the RISC-V programs by showing the contents of registers along with the memory after each instruction execution. For more information about the details of the project, please refer to the project report.

## Features
* Simulate the RISC-V Assembly instructions
* Help debugging assembly programs
* Show the values of the registers and memory after each assembly instruction
* Output the values in Binary, Hexadecimal and Decimal
